# Linux Shell
A basic modular Linux shell, command interpreter.

## Source code
To compile source code of this shell you have to compile steps that are inside `compile_shell.c` file.  
This can be done by GNU C Compile or Tiny C Compiler as per recent testing.  

After this, execute the `compile_shell` binary and the rest of the project will be compiled.     
GNU C Compiler: `gcc compile_shell.c && ./a.out`  
Tiny C Compiler: `tcc -run compile_shell.c`
